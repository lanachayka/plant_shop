        "care": "The optimum temperature for this plant is +22-24 °C throughout the year. At the same time, cooling in winter to +15 °C and warming in summer to +30 °C are quite acceptable. But the palm tree does not tolerate sudden changes in temperature."

        "description": "This plant has chosen the tropical rainforests of Brazil and Guiana. This climbing vine with elliptical or oblong, lanceolate, pointed leaves at the ends makes an indelible impression even on those who have nothing to do with floriculture. Its leaves are about 20 cm long, while the width does not exceed 6 cm.",
        "care": "A damp greenhouse or florarium is the most suitable place for this species. Under comfortable conditions, the leaves gain strength and become large, and the distance of internodes decreases."
